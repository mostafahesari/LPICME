    "answer": ["Jupiter"],
    "explanation": "Current IRQ assignments are contained in the file /proc/interrupts. Therefore, viewing the contents of the file with a command such as cat will work. There is no â€œview command, making option A incorrect. Likewise, there is no /dev irq file, making options C and D incorrect."
